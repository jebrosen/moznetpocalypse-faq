# MozNetpocalypse FAQ

Many members of the Rust community are active in the mozilla IRC server
(MozNet). Mozilla has announced that they will be retiring MozNet, starting a
series of conversations regarding the future of these IRC channels and
communities.

## Timeline/Overview

* 2011: #rust is registered on mozilla IRC
* Mid-late 2018: Some official rust teams migrate off IRC, to platforms such as
  Discord and zulip:
  [announcement](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/exploring-new-communication-channels/7859),
  [background](https://yakshav.es/from-the-rider-down/).
* April 26, 2019: Mozilla announces that MozNet will be discontinued: [mhoye's
  announcement](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2019/04/26/synchronous-text/)
* April 26, 2019: Rust makes a statement regarding the shutdown. The post names
  the official Discord and several other unofficial platforms as alternatives:

  [reddit
  thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/bhrm7g/mozilla_irc_sunset_and_the_rust_channel/)
* April 26, 2019: Some users and channels begin discussing migration plans,
  creating new channels, and so on.

## Where will all the channels go!?!?

### Internal discussions and working groups

A lot of internal discussion channels and rust team communications have already
moved to Discord and Zulip, at the discretion of individual teams.

### Rust support and discussion channels

Equivalents of #rust and #rust-beginners (MozNet), #users, #help, and
#beginners (Discord), and so on will continue to exist on the official and
community Discord servers. These channels will also continue exist or start
appearing on other IRC networks, but no official space other than Discord has
been announced at this time.

* freenode/##rust, oftc/#rust

### Miscellaneous rust rooms Unofficial channels and specific topic channels
such as #rust-offtopic, #rust-(language), #rust-networking will have to find
new homes. Some users or channels will likely go to another IRC server such as
OFTC or freenode, some to community-maintained servers on Discord, matrix,
zulip, slack, gitter, etc.

* freenode/##rust-offtopic, oftc/#rust-offtopic

### Rust project channels

Projects that have IRC channels on MozNet, such as #cranelift, #diesel, #gfx,
#hyper, #rocket, and #servo, will be up to those projects to decide. Many of
these already have other support avenues, and may just drop IRC. Others might
move to matrix, Discord, or another IRC network. If you know of any decisions,
they can be added here as examples.

### Non-rust channels

I have not followed these discussions; most of these will go to other servers
and/or whatever platform mozilla chooses for itself.

* PRs welcome to add additional details.

## Notes

* I am attempting to keep this an unbiased summary of events and future
  directions. I am not interested in discussing the merits or demerits of any
  specific platforms in this space.
* Issues and PRs to add or correct information are welcome and encouraged.
